## Overview 
The goal of analysis for module number 1 is to help louise better understand how funding campaigns performed based on launch dates and funding goals. Looking at this data will help with understanding when or what will be needed to start a play and if it has the possibility to meet the goal requirements. Based on this analysis we can understand when during the year is best to launch a campaign and the likelihood of success.
## Analysis and Challenges
I have perfomed my analysis with multipule steps such as using filters to identify the type of category and sub category I wanted to identify. I have also used conditional formating to better visualize the successes, failures and cancelled outcomes. Then with all of the filters in place I was able to create graphs that show the trends to each outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of outcomes based on launch dates is that the time to launch a campain for a theater  campain is in May since it has the highest success rate out of the graph and that December is the worst time to start a campain since it aligns with the low successes and those that have failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, the data shows that projects will be more successful if the goal is less than 5000. The data also shows that there is a even corralation between successes and failures as shown in the line graph. There may be a reason that the relationship between the success and failures fall and rise at an even rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I have encountered was the COUNTIF formulas needed. Going and looking back at module 1.2.2 and 1.3.2 as well a google assisted me in finding the best way to utilize the formula as I understand it. One this was finished the second challenge was to ensure that the graph had similar output that the data set had. This was done by going back an double checking to see the amounts were the same as the amounts I had recieved from the COUNTIF formula.

I then had another challenge when I realized somehow I had edited the data set to show incorrect findings. So I then went back redownloaded the original data set and copy pasted into what I had been working on and it ended up working out and showing the data I wanted to see.

## Results
The conclusions I have found with Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the best time to start a campaign would be in May and that the worst time to start a campaign would be in December. I have also found that in the Outcomes Based on Goals that there is a correlation that makes the data rise and fall evenly.
The limit to this dataset would be that in the Outcomes Based on Goals that it doesn't show of what made the data move the way it did such as if these were plays or if this was for a different subcategory.
The possible tables to have would be a comparison on an outcome based type of theater act such as plays, musicals, ect. I would also create a box and whisker plot to see if there are any outliers on why certain goals where not met and by how much.
