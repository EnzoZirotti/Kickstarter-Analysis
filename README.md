## Overview 
The goal of analysis for module number 1 is to help louise better understand how funding campaigns performed based on launch dates and funding goals. Looking at this data will help with understanding when or what will be needed to start a play and if it has the possibility to meet the goal requirements. Based on this analysis we can understand when during the year is best to launch a campaign and the likelihood of success.
## Analysis and Challenges
I have perfomed my analysis multipule steps such as using filters to identify the type of category and sub category I wanted to identify. I have also used conditional formating to better visualize the successes, failures and cancelled outcomes. Then with all of the filters in place I was able to create graphs that show the trends to each outcome. The biggest challenge I have encountered was the COUNTIF formulas needed. Going and looking back at module 1.2.2 and 1.3.2 as well a google assisted me in finding the best way to utilize the formula as I understand it. One this was finished the second challenge was to ensure that the graph had similar output that the data set had. This was done by going back an double checking to see the amounts were the same as the amounts I had recieved from the COUNTIF formula.

I then had another challenge when I realized somehow I had edited the data set to show incorrect findings. So I then went back redownloaded the original data set and copy pasted into what I had been working on and it ended up working out and showing the data I wanted to see.
